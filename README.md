# Evil-Wi-Fi-1.2
Evil Wi-Fi 1.2 is an open-source project for security awareness and training. It simulates common rogue Wi-Fi scenarios (like fake firmware update pages or captive portals) in a safe, controlled environment. The goal is to help developers, students, and IT teams understand how such attacks look and learn how to defend against them.
